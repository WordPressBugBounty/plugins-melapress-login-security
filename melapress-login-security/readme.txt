== Description ==

<strong> COMPREHENSIVE WORDPRESS LOGIN SECURITY PLUGIN </strong>

[Melapress Login Security](https://melapress.com/wordpress-login-security/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=mls) enables you to effortlessly set login security policies that put you firmly in the driver’s seat of your WordPress sites. Policies are highly customizable and granular and can be implemented by user role or site-wide for complete control over the security of your WordPress login processes.

Use the free edition of Melapress Login Security to implement WordPress password requirements such as minimum length and complexity rules. The plugin also allows you to set password expiration policies, prevent password reuse, limit failed login attempts, and automatically disable inactive user accounts, among other things. This helps you:

- Prevent unauthorized login attempts
- Protect against brute force attacks
- Comply with GDPR with a login consent notice

## Features list

A secure WordPress login starts right here. Explore all of the features included with the free edition of [Melapress Login Security](https://melapress.com/wordpress-login-security):

### Set password policies

Strong passwords are your first line of defense against bad actors looking to gain access to your site. Set password requirement policies to make sure users set strong passwords. Set policies by user role or site-wide and define policy priority for users with multiple roles.

- Set minimum password length
- Mandate use of upper case and lower case characters, numeric digits, and special characters
- Set an automatic password expiration policy and advise users when their password is about to expire
- Disallow users from recycling passwords
- Provide users with helpful instructions during the password configuration stage
- Disable password reset links
- Mandate WordPress password reset on the first login

### Limit login attempts

[Limit failed login attempts](https://melapress.com/support/kb/melapress-login-security-failed-logins-policy-wordpress/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=mls) and put an end to brute force attacks. Protect your login form by automatically disabling user accounts after a number of failed login attempts. Choose between manual unlocking by an admin or automatic unlock after a cooldown period.

### Temporary login without password

Provide temporary and secure login access to third-parties, like developers, editors, employees or others, without a password. It works by providing the user with a temporary login link that expires after a certain amount of time, or after a number of uses. This prevents you from having to create new user accounts manually, while simultaneously reducing the security risks associated with old, unused user accounts.

### Change WordPress login URL

Easily deploy security-by-obscurity tactics and change your WordPress login page URL using a plugin! Hiding the default login page from hackers makes it more difficult to find, potentially reducing brute force attacks and other unauthorized access attempts. After you change the default wp-admin URL, you can set a 404 for the old login page or redirect it to any page of your choosing.

### Limit login page access by IP address(es)

Limit access to the WordPress login page by IP address(es) for additional security.

### GDPR login page consent notice

Easily meet GDPR requirements by adding a GDPR consent notice to the login page. This is required for GDPR and PCI DSS compliance, thus ensuring your WordPress site login page is in compliance.

### Emergency password reset

Discovered suspicious behavior? Reset all users’ passwords with just one click and regain instant control.

## Upgrade to Melapress Login Security Premium and get even more benefits.

The premium edition of Melapress Login Security comes bundled with even more features, which enable you to take your WordPress website login security to the next level. Disable inactive WordPress user accounts and force passwords to be reset once accounts have been unlocked. Inactive accounts can be managed within a single dashboard for increased efficiency and faster response times. Moreover, you can set accounts to be locked out after a number of failed login attempts and customize the duration and method of unlocking them.

### Premium features list

- Everything in the free version
- Add an additional security layer with security questions users must answer when performing actions such as password reset and account unlock
- Automatically send users an email whenever there's a login with their username from an unrecognized device with an option to terminate the session remotely

= Can I get support if I get stuck? =

Support for the Free edition of the plugin is provided only via the WordPress.org support forums. You can also refer to our [support pages](https://melapress.com/support/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=mls) for all the technical and product documentation.

= How does Melapress Login Security secure my website? =

Melapress Login Security secures different aspects of the WordPress login process to increase the overall security of your site. Depending on which edition you get and which policies you activate, the plugin is flexible enough to enable you to be as restrictive as you like.

While the plugin is extensive, it is not a silver bullet, and you should still take other security measures, such as enabling two factor authentication.

= How does limiting login attempts improve security? =

Brute force attacks rely on unlimited login attempts to try as many username and password combinations as possible until they hit the right combination. By limiting login attempts, you effectively stop brute force attacks by removing the one thing they rely on to breach your login page.

= How effective is changing the default WordPress login URL? =

Changing the login page URL is a security technique known as security-by-obscurity. Its entire premise is to make resources harder to find - but not impossible. This means that changing the wp-admin page URL can be an effective strategy when combined with other techniques such as using strong passwords and two factor authentication.
