## Features list

A secure WordPress login starts right here. Explore all of the features included with the free edition of [Melapress Login Security](https://melapress.com/wordpress-login-security):

### Set password policies

Strong passwords are your first line of defense against bad actors looking to gain access to your site. Set password requirement policies to make sure users set strong passwords. Set policies by user role or site-wide and define policy priority for users with multiple roles.

- Set minimum password length
- Mandate use of upper case and lower case characters, numeric digits, and special characters
- Set an automatic password expiration policy and advise users when their password is about to expire

### Limit login attempts

[Limit failed login attempts](https://melapress.com/support/kb/melapress-login-security-failed-logins-policy-wordpress/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=mls) and put an end to brute force attacks. Protect your login form by automatically disabling user accounts after a number of failed login attempts. Choose between manual unlocking by an admin or automatic unlock after a cooldown period.

### Change WordPress login URL

Easily deploy security-by-obscurity tactics and change your WordPress login page URL using a plugin!

After you change the default wp-admin URL, you can set a 404 for the old login page or redirect it to any page of your choosing.

### GDPR login page consent notice

Easily meet GDPR requirements by adding a GDPR consent notice to the login page. This is required for GDPR and PCI DSS compliance, thus ensuring your WordPress site login page is in compliance.

### Emergency password reset

Changing the login page URL is a security technique known as security-by-obscurity. Its entire premise is to make resources harder to find - but not impossible.
